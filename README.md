There are three choices that customers can select:  
  1) Flexibile on time and need economical solution.  This will be used for classroom projects and the customer understand that it could be several months or longer but at a very economical rate.
  
  2) Not as flexible and still need econimical.  This will be awarded to a student who wants to freelance on their own (and could possibly use as class project - it depends) and can focus more time to the project and meeting needs of the customer.  
  
  3) Needs project with a quicker turnaround and can pay a little mroe.  This will be awarded to an alumni looking for freelance work or an advanced enrolled student.
  
  The business plan is similar to a temp agency.  Customer would pay Bytes and Bits 10% of what the total price is awarded to group, person, etc.  
  
  The service that Bytes and Bits provides is vetting of individuals who take the project via the college faculty on the student's skill level.  The student will also have resources to them via the college and professors.
